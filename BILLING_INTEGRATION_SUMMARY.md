# Billing Integration with Profile - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated billing and subscription management functionality into the user profile section of the Certifai app. Users can now create and manage Stripe subscriptions directly from their profile page.

- Tab uses the CreditCard icon and fits with the existing design
- Automatically controlled tab navigation with React state

#### Updated Profile Header

- Shows subscription status (Active, Trial, Canceling, etc.)
- Falls back to "Free Tier" when no active subscription

#### Enhanced Account Tab

- Real-time subscription information from Stripe
- Dynamic status badges based on subscription state
- Next billing date display for active subscriptions
- "Manage Billing" button that navigates to the billing tab

### 2. Stripe Integration Components

4. Redirects to Stripe checkout page
5. After successful payment, returns to success callback
6. Profile automatically shows new subscription information

### Existing Subscriber Management Flow

2. Clicks "Manage Billing" to navigate to billing tab
3. Can cancel, resume, or modify subscription
4. Access Stripe customer portal for advanced billing management
5. All changes reflect immediately in the profile

### Profile Header Integration

- Always shows current subscription status
- Updates in real-time as subscriptions change
- Provides quick visual confirmation of subscription state

## Benefits
