# Fix for Loading Page Issue After Signin with Different Accounts

## Problem Description

Users were getting stuck on the loading page after signing in, especially when using different accounts. This issue was caused by cached authentication state and race conditions in the authentication flow after the recent security enhancements.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by several interconnected problems:

1. **Incomplete Auth State Clearing**: When switching between different user accounts, the previous authentication state wasn't being completely cleared, causing conflicts.

2. **AuthGuard Timeout Issues**: The AuthGuard component's 5-second timeout for API user ID wasn't working reliably, causing users to get stuck indefinitely.

3. **Race Conditions in Firebase Auth Context**: When switching users, the authentication setup could fail silently, leaving users without proper API user ID.

4. **Cookie Caching Issues**: Browser cookie caching combined with the new JWT security enhancements was causing stale authentication state to persist.

5. **Missing Emergency Fallbacks**: No safety mechanisms to handle cases where authentication gets stuck.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Authentication State Clearing

**File**: `src/context/FirebaseAuthContext.tsx`

- Added detection for user account switching (different UIDs)
- Force clear previous auth state when different user is detected
- Improved error handling with explicit null setting for API user ID on failures

### 2. Improved AuthGuard Resilience

**File**: `src/components/custom/AuthGuard.tsx`

- Added comprehensive debugging logs for auth state changes
- Implemented 20-second emergency timeout to prevent infinite loading
- Enhanced condition to allow access with Firebase auth only if API timeout occurs
- Better timeout state management

### 3. Enhanced Cookie Clearing

**File**: `app/api/auth-cookie/clear/route.ts`

- Added explicit cookie expiration with maxAge: 0
- Set cookies to empty values before deletion for better browser compatibility
- Improved handling of both current and legacy cookie names

### 4. Improved Authentication State Reset

**File**: `src/lib/auth-utils.ts`

- Added retry logic for server-side cookie clearing
- Enhanced client-side storage clearing with error handling
- Force clear cookies via document.cookie as additional measure
- Better error handling for edge cases

### 5. Enhanced Middleware Security

**File**: `middleware.ts`

- Improved legacy token detection and clearing
- Added explicit cookie expiration in redirect responses
- Better error messages for session expiration

### 6. Signin Page Improvements

**File**: `app/signin/page.tsx`

- Allow redirect on authentication timeout errors
- Better handling of stuck authentication states

## Technical Details

### User Switching Detection

```typescript
// If switching users (different UID), clear previous state first
if (firebaseUser && authUser && firebaseUser.uid !== authUser.uid) {
  console.log('Different user detected, clearing previous auth state...');
  setFirebaseUser(null);
  setFirebaseToken(null);
  setApiUserId(null);
  clearAuthCookie();
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
}
```

### Emergency Timeout Protection

```typescript
// Emergency redirect if user is stuck in loading state too long (20 seconds)
useEffect(() => {
  if (loading || (firebaseUser && !apiUserId && !apiTimeout)) {
    const emergencyTimer = setTimeout(() => {
      console.error('AuthGuard: User stuck in loading state for 20 seconds, forcing redirect');
      router.push(
        '/signin?error=' +
          encodeURIComponent('Authentication timed out. Please try signing in again.'),
      );
    }, 20000);

    return () => clearTimeout(emergencyTimer);
  }
}, [loading, firebaseUser, apiUserId, apiTimeout, router]);
```

### Enhanced Cookie Clearing

```typescript
// Force clear cookies via document.cookie as additional measure
try {
  document.cookie = 'authToken=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/';
  document.cookie = 'joseToken=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT; path=/';
} catch (e) {
  console.warn('Failed to clear cookies via document.cookie:', e);
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **Resolved Loading Page Issues**

- Users no longer get stuck on loading page after signin
- Different accounts can be used without authentication conflicts
- Proper fallback mechanisms prevent infinite loading states

### ✅ **Improved Account Switching**

- Clean state transitions between different user accounts
- Proper clearing of previous user's authentication data
- No cross-user data contamination

### ✅ **Enhanced Error Recovery**

- Emergency timeout mechanisms prevent stuck states
- Better error messages guide users to resolution
- Graceful degradation when API calls fail

### ✅ **Better Security**

- Complete authentication state clearing prevents token reuse
- Enhanced cookie management prevents caching issues
- Proper handling of legacy and corrupted tokens

### ✅ **Improved Debugging**

- Comprehensive logging for authentication state changes
- Better error tracking and diagnosis capabilities
- Clear indication of what's happening during auth flow

## Testing Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. **Test Account Switching**:

   - Sign in with Account A
   - Sign out completely
   - Sign in with Account B
   - Verify smooth transition to main page

2. **Test Loading Recovery**:

   - If loading page appears, it should resolve within 5-20 seconds
   - Emergency timeout should redirect to signin with clear error message

3. **Test Cookie Clearing**:

   - Check browser dev tools that old cookies are properly cleared
   - Verify no stale authentication state persists

4. **Monitor Console Logs**:
   - Look for "Different user detected" messages during account switching
   - Verify "AuthGuard state update" logs show proper progression
   - Check for "Authentication setup completed successfully" messages

## Edge Cases Handled

- **Corrupted Authentication State**: Emergency timeouts and forced redirects
- **API Server Unavailable**: Graceful degradation with Firebase auth only
- **Network Issues**: Retry logic and proper error handling
- **Browser Cookie Caching**: Multiple clearing strategies
- **Concurrent Authentication Attempts**: Proper state management
- **Incomplete Authentication Setup**: Explicit null setting and timeout handling

This comprehensive fix ensures that users can reliably access the main application after signin, regardless of which account they use or previous authentication state.
