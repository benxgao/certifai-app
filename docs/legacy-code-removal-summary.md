# Legacy Code Removal Summary

## Files Successfully Removed âœ…

### 1. Complex Monitoring Hook

- **File**: `src/hooks/useExamGenerationMonitor.ts`
- **Purpose**: Complex exam generation monitoring with time-based estimates and batch tracking
- **Reason for Removal**: Replaced with simplified `useExamGeneratingProgress` hook

### 2. Complex Generation Utilities

- **File**: `src/lib/examGenerationUtils.ts`
- **Purpose**: Time-based estimation algorithms and smart polling intervals
- **Reason for Removal**: Replaced with simple RTDB topic counting approach

### 3. Demo/Example Code

- **File**: `src/lib/examGenerationDemo.ts`
- **Purpose**: Example usage of complex estimation functions
- **Reason for Removal**: No longer relevant with simplified approach

## Files Updated with Simple Replacements âœ…

### 1. SWR Exams Hook

- **File**: `src/swr/exams.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `getSmartPollingInterval` import
  - Replaced complex polling logic with simple 3-second interval
  - Maintained same SWR functionality

### 2. Exam List Monitor

- **File**: `src/hooks/useExamListGenerationMonitor.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `getSmartPollingInterval` import
  - Replaced complex interval calculation with simple 5-second polling
  - Maintained same monitoring functionality

## Benefits of Cleanup ðŸŽ¯

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed ~300+ lines of complex estimation code
2. **Better Maintainability**: Simple static intervals are easier to understand
3. **No Functional Loss**: All UI behavior preserved with simplified backend
4. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed unused utility functions and demo code
5. **Consistent Architecture**: All progress tracking now uses unified API approach

## Verification âœ…

- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] No broken imports remaining
- [x] All references to removed files cleaned up
- [x] Simple polling intervals working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated

The legacy question generating progress code has been completely removed and replaced with the simplified, more accurate approach that relies on actual RTDB data rather than time-based estimates.
