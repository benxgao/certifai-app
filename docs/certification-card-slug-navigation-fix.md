# Certification Card Navigation Fix - Summary

## Issue

The certification cards on the main certifications page (`/certifications`) were using `cert_id` instead of slugs in their navigation links, breaking SEO-friendly routing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Slug Utility Functions (`/src/utils/slug.ts`)

- `createSlug(name: string)`: Converts certification names to URL-friendly slugs
- `normalizeSlug(slug: string)`: Normalizes existing slugs
- `isValidSlug(slug: string)`: Validates slug format
- Handles special characters, spaces, and creates consistent URL-friendly formats

### 2. Added Missing Server Action (`/src/lib/server-actions/certifications.ts`)

- Added `fetchCertificationDataBySlug(slug: string)` function
- This function was being imported in multiple files but was missing from the server actions
- Includes API fallback and mock data support for development
- Added `getMockCertificationDataBySlug(slug: string)` helper function

### 3. Fixed Navigation Links (`/src/components/custom/CertificationsOverviewClient.tsx`)

- **Line 232**: Changed `href={`/certifications/${firm.code}/${cert.cert_id}`}`
- **To**: `href={`/certifications/${firm.code}/${createSlug(cert.name)}`}`
- Added import for `createSlug` from the utility functions

## How It Works

1. **Slug Generation**: Certification names like "AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate" become "aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate"

2. **Routing**: Cards now link to `/certifications/aws/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate` instead of `/certifications/aws/123`

3. **API Support**: The slug-based routing is supported by:
   - Existing API endpoint: `/api/public/certifications/slug/[slug]/route.ts`
   - New server action: `fetchCertificationDataBySlug()`
   - Existing page routes: `/app/certifications/[firmCode]/[slug]/page.tsx`

## Examples

| Certification Name                            | Old Link                        | New Link                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate | `/certifications/aws/123`       | `/certifications/aws/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate` |
| Microsoft Azure Fundamentals                  | `/certifications/microsoft/456` | `/certifications/microsoft/microsoft-azure-fundamentals`          |
| CompTIA Security+                             | `/certifications/comptia/789`   | `/certifications/comptia/comptia-security`                        |

## Benefits

1. **SEO-Friendly URLs**: Descriptive URLs instead of numeric IDs
2. **Better User Experience**: URLs are readable and meaningful
3. **Consistent Routing**: All certification pages now use the same slug-based pattern
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Old cert_id routes still work alongside new slug routes

## Testing

- ✅ Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ Slug generation tested and working correctly
- ✅ Development server starts without issues
- ✅ Certification page loads properly with new slug-based links

The navigation links now properly use SEO-friendly slugs as requested!
