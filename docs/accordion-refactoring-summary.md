# Accordion Components Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully extracted reusable accordion components from the question explanations section and refactored the "Topics for this page" section to use the new accordion system.

## Files Created

### 1. `/src/components/custom/CustomAccordion.tsx`

- **Purpose**: Base reusable accordion component with multiple styling variants
- **Features**:
  - Support for single/multiple selection modes
  - Pre-built styling variants (default, explanation, topics, custom)
  - Flexible icon and content support
  - TypeScript interfaces for type safety
  - Built on top of existing shadcn/ui accordion primitives

### 2. `/src/components/custom/ExplanationAccordion.tsx`

- **Purpose**: Specialized component for question explanations
- **Features**:
  - Blue-themed styling matching existing design
  - Lightbulb icon for visual consistency
  - Automatic paragraph parsing for explanations
  - Customizable trigger text

### 3. `/src/components/custom/TopicsAccordion.tsx`

- **Purpose**: Specialized component for exam topics display
- **Features**:
  - Violet-themed styling consistent with topics
  - Book icon and question count badges
  - Grid layout for topic items
  - Support for both accordion and non-accordion modes
  - Loading states and empty state handling

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/components/custom/QuestionCard.tsx`

- **Changes**:
  - Removed inline accordion implementation
  - Replaced with `ExplanationAccordion` component
  - Cleaned up imports (removed accordion-related imports)
  - Maintained exact same functionality and styling

### 2. `/src/components/custom/ExamTopicsDisplay.tsx`

- **Changes**:
  - Added `useAccordion` and `defaultExpanded` props
  - Integrated `TopicsAccordion` component
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing API
  - Enhanced with new accordion display option

## Documentation Created

### `/docs/reusable-accordion-components.md`

Comprehensive documentation including:

- Component usage examples
- Props interfaces
- Migration guide
- Best practices
- Future enhancement ideas

## Technical Improvements

### 1. **Reusability**

- Accordion functionality now available throughout the application
- Three levels of abstraction (CustomAccordion → specialized components → usage)
- Consistent behavior and accessibility standards

### 2. **Type Safety**

- Full TypeScript interfaces for all components
- Proper handling of Radix UI accordion type constraints
- Type-safe props for different accordion modes

### 3. **Styling Consistency**

- Pre-built variants ensure visual consistency
- Follows existing design patterns (violet/purple/blue gradients)
- Glass-morphism and dark mode support maintained

### 4. **Accessibility**

- Built on Radix UI primitives for proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

## Breaking Changes

- **None**: All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Existing `QuestionCard` usage remains the same
- Existing `ExamTopicsDisplay` usage remains the same

## Migration Path

Components can be gradually migrated to use the new accordion system:

1. **Immediate**: Question explanations now use `ExplanationAccordion`
2. **Optional**: Topics displays can opt into accordion mode with `useAccordion={true}`
3. **Future**: New features can use `CustomAccordion` for consistent accordion behavior

## Benefits Achieved

1. **DRY Principle**: Eliminated duplicate accordion implementation code
2. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for accordion behavior
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to create new accordion variants
4. **Consistency**: Uniform interaction patterns across the application
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear interfaces and comprehensive documentation

## Usage Examples

```tsx
// Question explanations (automatic migration)
<ExplanationAccordion explanations={question.explanations} />

// Topics with accordion (new option)
<ExamTopicsDisplay useAccordion={true} defaultExpanded={false} {...props} />

// Custom accordion for new features
<CustomAccordion items={customItems} variant="custom" />
```

The refactoring successfully extracts reusable components while maintaining all existing functionality and providing a solid foundation for future accordion implementations.
