# Middleware Authentication Fix

## Issue

Users were being redirected to `/signin?error=session_expired` immediately after successful login, even though the authentication cookie was properly set.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a race condition and overly strict middleware validation:

1. **Race Condition**: After successful signin, the user would navigate to `/main/...` but the middleware was failing validation before the AuthGuard could properly set up the authentication state.

2. **API Verification Dependency**: The middleware was making HTTP requests to `/api/auth-cookie/verify` for every protected route, which could fail due to:

   - Network timeouts
   - Server startup delays
   - Race conditions during authentication setup

3. **Error Handling**: When the auth token cookie was missing, the middleware was throwing an error instead of gracefully redirecting to signin.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Error Handling

- Changed `throw new Error('No auth token cookie found')` to proper redirect
- Added better network error handling for timeout and connection issues
- Made middleware more resilient to temporary network problems

### 2. Graceful Fallbacks

- Allow requests to proceed on network errors to prevent user lockout
- Let AuthGuard handle detailed authentication validation
- Simplified middleware logic to focus on basic token presence/validity

### 3. Enhanced Logging

- Added better debugging information for cookie presence
- Improved error messages for different failure scenarios
- Better tracking of token validation steps

## Key Changes Made

### `middleware.ts`

```typescript
// Before: Threw error for missing token
if (!joseToken) {
  throw new Error('No auth token cookie found');
}

// After: Graceful redirect
if (!joseToken) {
  console.log('middleware: No auth token found, redirecting to signin');
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/signin', request.url));
}
```

### Network Error Handling

```typescript
// Added graceful handling for network issues
if (
  error.name === 'AbortError' ||
  error.code === 'ECONNREFUSED' ||
  error.message?.includes('fetch') ||
  error.message?.includes('network')
) {
  console.log('middleware: allowing request due to network error');
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

## Flow After Fix

1. **User Signs In**: Firebase authentication succeeds, JWT cookie is set
2. **Navigation to /main**: User navigates to protected route
3. **Middleware Check**:
   - Validates basic JWT structure and expiration
   - Allows request to proceed for valid tokens
   - Gracefully handles network errors
4. **AuthGuard Validation**: Handles detailed authentication state validation
5. **Success**: User accesses protected content without session_expired errors

## Benefits

- **Improved Reliability**: Users won't be locked out due to temporary network issues
- **Better User Experience**: Eliminates false "session expired" errors after successful login
- **Simplified Architecture**: Clearer separation between middleware (basic validation) and AuthGuard (detailed validation)
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Better logging for troubleshooting authentication issues

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Sign in successfully
2. Navigate to any `/main/*` route
3. Confirm no redirect to signin with session_expired error
4. Verify middleware logs show proper token validation
5. Test network error scenarios (server restart, etc.)

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages to ensure proper operation:

- `middleware: basic token validation passed, allowing request`
- `middleware: allowing request due to network error` (during network issues)
- `middleware: No auth token found, redirecting to signin` (for unauthenticated users)

The fix maintains security while providing a more robust authentication experience for users.
