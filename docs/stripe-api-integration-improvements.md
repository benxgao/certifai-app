# Frontend-Backend API Integration Improvements

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling in Frontend API Routes**

#### **Account API Routes** (`/app/api/stripe/account/`)

- ✅ Added response validation before parsing JSON
- ✅ Added specific error handling for authentication failures

#### **Checkout Session API** (`/app/api/stripe/checkout/create-session/`)

- ✅ Added comprehensive input validation (price_id format, trial_days)
- ✅ Added response structure validation
- ✅ Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios

### 2. **Improved Server-Side Utilities** (`/src/stripe/server/`)

#### **serverFetchWithAuth Function**

- ✅ Added endpoint validation (must start with `/`)
- ✅ Added 30-second timeout to prevent hanging requests
- ✅ Added better error handling for network issues
- ✅ Added context to error messages

#### **getServerPricingPlans Function**

- ✅ Added 15-second timeout
- ✅ Added response structure validation
- ✅ Changed return value from `null` to structured error object
- ✅ Better error logging and context

### 3. **Enhanced SWR Hooks** (`/src/stripe/client/swr.ts`)

#### **Fetcher Functions**

- ✅ Added error context with URL information
- ✅ Added payload validation for POST requests
- ✅ Enhanced error logging with request details

#### **useUnifiedAccountData Hook**

- ✅ Added account data structure validation
- ✅ Added required fields validation
- ✅ Added `requiresReauth` flag for better auth handling
- ✅ Enhanced subscription data integrity checks

### 4. **Improved Checkout Flow** (`/src/stripe/client/hooks/useCheckoutFlow.ts`)

#### **startCheckoutFlow Function**

- ✅ Added price ID format validation
- ✅ Added checkout URL validation before redirect
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with specific messages
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript error handling

## Key Improvements

### **Data Integrity**

1. **Request Validation**: All inputs are validated before being sent to backend
2. **Response Validation**: All responses are validated before being processed
3. **Field Validation**: Required fields are checked and missing fields are logged
4. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript error handling throughout

### **Error Handling**

1. **Contextual Errors**: Errors now include URL and payload information
2. **Specific Messages**: Different error types have specific user-facing messages
3. **Authentication Flow**: Better handling of auth failures with `requiresReauth` flag
4. **Timeout Protection**: Network requests have timeouts to prevent hanging

### **Reliability**

1. **Request Timeouts**: 30s for authenticated requests, 15s for public requests
2. **Structured Responses**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints
3. **Retry Logic**: Better error recovery and user feedback
4. **Data Consistency**: Validation ensures data integrity between frontend and backend

### **Developer Experience**

1. **Better Logging**: More informative error messages with context
2. **Validation Feedback**: Clear warnings when data doesn't meet expectations
3. **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript support throughout the chain
4. **Debugging**: Enhanced error context for easier troubleshooting

## Testing Recommendations

### **Frontend API Routes**

- [ ] Test with invalid authentication tokens
- [ ] Test with malformed request payloads
- [ ] Test timeout scenarios
- [ ] Test backend service unavailability

### **Checkout Flow**

- [ ] Test with invalid price IDs
- [ ] Test checkout URL validation
- [ ] Test authentication failure during checkout
- [ ] Test subscription status after successful payment

### **Data Synchronization**

- [ ] Test account data refresh after subscription changes
- [ ] Test data consistency between hooks
- [ ] Test error recovery scenarios
- [ ] Test webhook processing delays

## Configuration Notes

### **Environment Variables Required**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_API_URL`: Backend API base URL
- Firebase authentication configuration
- Stripe public key configuration

### **Timeout Settings**

- Authenticated requests: 30 seconds
- Public requests (pricing): 15 seconds
- Checkout success polling: Up to 10 seconds (5 attempts × 2s)

This comprehensive improvement ensures better reliability, user experience, and maintainability of the Stripe integration.
